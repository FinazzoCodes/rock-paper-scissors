# Rock Paper Scissors

For this Odin project, the task was to create a game of rock, paper, scissors in JavaScript from scratch. The game's rules were to randomly generate a selection from the computer, prompt the user for their selection, generate a game that consist of 5 rounds, and finally display a winner.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub

## Skills Gained

- **Functions:** Code defines several functions, which are reusable for specific tasks. The function created where `getComputerChoice`, `getUserChoice`, `playRound` and `generateGame`.
- **Random Number Generation:** The `getComputerChoice` function uses `Math.random()` to generate a random number to select a choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer.
- **User Input and Validation:** The `getUserChoice` function takes input via `prompt` function and validates it to ensure it's one of the valid choices.
- **Other Skills Utilized:** _Conditional Statements_ (for determining winners), _Variables_ (global and local), _String Manipulation_ (using template literals), _Arithmetic Operations_ (incrementing score, etc...), _Loops_ (for loops to play multiple rounds).
